          "content-line1": "For general Japanese people there is only a vague image of Vietnam and Vietnamese women. I think of the Vietnam War as a little old generation. However, nearly 40 years after the war, the memory of war has become a thing of the past. Two generations ago, I am not interested in grandparents' events. They have only feelings that they love the United States of America. Moreover, the South has a deep relationship with the US",
          "content-line2": "Vietnamese women are serious. This is my first impression. And I love love and I have a respect for men I work much better. If you are straight in love, serious and working well, I feel that there is no condition for marriage any more for men. Divorce is a terrible event for Vietnamese women. Therefore, Vietnamese women do not divorce as long as there is no good public knowledge or violence / cheating, and in that sense the biggest risk for men is not large from the beginning."

          "content-line1": "I think Vietnamese women are most suitable for Japanese people. First of all, young Vietnamese women appear to be Japanese, if they look like Japanese people and bring them to Japan. The temperament is reminiscent of the good old days of Japan. Honoring the elders with big familyism and cherishing their parents.",
          "content-line2": "Meanwhile new tools and ways of thinking are coming in and I do not feel old. Vietnamese women are serious and affectionate and respectful to men. Good women need to have the courage to take a step without being distracted by miscellaneous information, what they can understand at a glance"
